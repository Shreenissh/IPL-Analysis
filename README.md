# IPL Match and Deliveries Analysis Dataset
This repository contains data and code for analyzing and visualizing the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches and deliveries data. The IPL is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India that is played annually. This dataset contains match analysis data for all IPL matches from 2008 to 2020, as well as the deliveries data for each match.

## Data
The data is stored in two CSV files named matches.csv and deliveries.csv. The matches.csv file contains information on each IPL match, including the date, venue, teams, toss winner, toss decision, match result, and player of the match. The deliveries.csv file contains data on each ball bowled in each match, including the batting team, bowling team, over number, ball number, and runs scored off the ball.

Both files are sourced from Kaggle, and contain a total of 816 rows and 18 columns for matches, and 179,078 rows and 21 columns for deliveries.

## Code
The code for analyzing and visualizing the data is written in Python, and can be found in the analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains code for reading the data, cleaning and transforming it as necessary, and visualizing the data using various libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.

The notebook is organized into different sections that correspond to different types of analysis. The sections include:

Overview of the dataset <br />
Match results analysis <br />
Venue analysis <br />
Toss analysis <br />
Player of the match analysis <br />
Runs analysis <br />
Wickets analysis <br />
Bowlers analysis <br />
Batsmen analysis <br />
Each section contains code for generating the corresponding analysis and visualization, as well as a brief description of the insights that can be gained from the visualization.

## How to use
To use this dataset, simply download the matches.csv and deliveries.csv files and open the analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook. Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly. You can then run each section of the notebook to generate the corresponding analysis and visualization.
